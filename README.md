# floridaconcertfinder
This is a database-driven web application that locates, adds,
and bookmarks all concerts booked in Florida (concert data retrieval started in August 2016).
The data contains venue links, venue locations, ticket prices, show times, artist genres, and more. Note: the data is STATIC!
(Later, maybe I'll write a webscraper in Python to grab the data dynamically... :) )
Ran on localhost with XAMPP for testing.
